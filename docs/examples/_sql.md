## Method chain (PHP 8.3+)

```php
// Load the schools data into an in-memory SQLite database.
$pdo = new PDO('sqlite::memory:');
$pdo->exec('CREATE TABLE schools (school TEXT, study_hours REAL, prior_score REAL, score REAL)');
$insert = $pdo->prepare('INSERT INTO schools VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)');
foreach (DataFrame::fromCsv('schools.csv')->toRows() as $row) {
    $insert->execute(array_values($row));
}

// The same functions build a query. Nothing runs until collect().
$query = phplyr(tbl($pdo, 'schools'))
    ->filter(col('study_hours')->ge(5))
    ->groupBy('school')
    ->summarise(students: n(), avg_score: mean('score'))
